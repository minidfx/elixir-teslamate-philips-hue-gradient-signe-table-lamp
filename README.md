# Tesla Charging Status

This project notifies anyone at home whether the car is charging or not. I created this project for personal use because sometimes we would leave home with an almost empty battery; either the car wasn’t plugged in or the charge hadn’t started.

*We don’t have* a Tesla charger at home; we use a Zaptec charger. Even if the cable is plugged in, the car won’t charge unless the charging process is started, otherwise, the light will stay red.

## Pre-requisites

This application is listening to the events emited by [Teslamate](https://github.com/teslamate-org/teslamate) on a MQTT server reachable and support only a [Philips Hue Signe Gradient Lamp](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-signe-gradient-floor-lamp/046677803513) to display the battery status.

## The color states

## Docker

I strongly suggest to use Docker to run the application but you can clone the project and run it manually.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  prod:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: minidfx/teslamate-charging-status:0.8.1
    environment:
